React Components
Components are the building blocks of React. They give you the ability to combine JavaScript and HTML to create self-contained pieces of functionality for a user interface. You can manage state and events with components, attach data to them, and even reuse them.  

Forum Feed Components 
Suppose you have a forum feed. It would contain several components, such as a header, navigation bar, and each individual post. To create a header without React, you’d use a <h1> tag in HTML, style it with CSS, and give it functionality with a JavaScript. If you created the same header as each component, you would use JSX to write HTML with JavaScript in the same file, giving your component form and functionality all in one place.  

What Components do you see? 
Review MIT’s homepage below. How would these UI elements be separated into components?

There could be several components, such as a logo component, a search bar component, a hero video component, and a footer component. Do you see others?
