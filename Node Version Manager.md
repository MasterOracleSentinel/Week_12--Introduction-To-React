Node Version Manager
-------------------------------

In the course of software development, rather than coding every piece of functionality from scratch, a software developer will have the opportunity to import outside utilities to add a modular piece of functionality to a project without requiring the developer to reinvent the wheel. These utilities are commonly known as dependencies.

When working with dependencies, developers must pay attention to the versions of different dependencies to know whether they will work together. A key concern is ensuring that each dependency is compatible with

NODE -- https://nodejs.org/en/about/

the JavaScript run-time environment.



A common way to deal with the changing Node version (in other words, the necessary run-time environment for project dependencies) between projects is to use a tool called Node Version Manager (NVM). This tool allows a developer to conveniently switch their Node version between projects according to the project needs.

The projects in this course were developed for Node version 14. Unless otherwise stated, you should use Node version 14 when completing projects for this course.

Action steps
You will start working with Node in this module. Take some time now to install Node Version Manager

(https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#readme -- NVM for Mac and Linux 

and https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows -- NVM for Windows)

Go through the installation steps described for your operating system, and then use NVM to install Node 14.

When you have successfully installed NVM and Node version 14, proceed to the next page to begin this moduleâ€™s exercise.
