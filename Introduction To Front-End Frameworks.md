Introduction to the React Library
-------------------------------------------
React is a declarative and component-based JavaScript library.

Declarative means that React updates the application interface when data changes. As an example of this declarative functionality, it is utilized when a user logs into their account and their name displays elsewhere on the screen.

Component-based design is the concept of writing small bits of functionality that are reusable throughout an application. For example, a blog website may have a component for a post, which contains details about the user who created the post, the contents of the post, and any actions others can take to like, share, or comment on that post. The post component is a structure with a set of rules about the data it takes in and how it displays it. Each of these elements could be broken down into smaller and smaller components, which you will learn more about later in this module.

Before you start using React, it is important to understand the role of frameworks and libraries in web development.
What Is A Framework?
A framework is a collection of tools and features built into a language that attempts to save a developer time by automating the mundane tasks they would normally have to complete manually

https://angular.io/

Angular a front-end framework that includes built-in functionality and a computer-line interface tool. Angular is opinionated, meaning that it enforces the developer to follow a specific folder structure and development practices.

For example, suppose you are developing a user input form. If you are using a framework like Angular, you will have to use specific, built-in form functionality to create it. A library, on the other hand, will allow you to create the form with more flexibility.

What Is A Library?
A library is an unopinionated collection of prewritten code. Unopinionated means that it offers flexibility and freedom when developing an application. React is a JavaScript library that has no one specific folder structure that you must follow and no built-in functionality for things like routing, forms, or network calls. Instead, the developer must decide how they will structure their project and what packages they will use.

When To Use A Framework Vs. A Library
Frameworks and libraries have advantages and disadvantages. Both options are widely used in the software development industry, and it is good to be familiar with them. You should choose what you use based on the needs of your project and your personal preferences.

-------------------------------
Framework
--------------
Advantages: You can develop an application quickly without making decisions upfront.
Disadvantages: You have less flexibility in how your application operates and what tools you can use.
Examples: Angular, Next.js, Redwood.js, Vue
---------------------------
Library
-------------
Advantages: You have complete control over the codebase and the flexibility to use several packages and tools within your application.
Disadvantages: You have to create the application manually and make several decisions, which will take longer.
Examples: React
------------------------------

 this course, you will learn how to use the React library and how to make decisions about the development of your application. After you learn how to leverage the library, if you want to add the framework functionality, you can use frameworks that are based on React (
