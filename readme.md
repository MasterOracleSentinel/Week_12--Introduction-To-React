Introduction To React
-------------------------------------
Introduction To React, you’ll create a simple React component, which is the foundational building block of a web page built using React. You’ll use the ES6 features you practiced in the last module to write clean, concise code in JSX, the JavaScript syntax extension you will use for React. By the end of the React section, you’ll be able to track button clicks on basic React components.

At the end of this module, you will have the opportunity to go through optional exercises with ES6 syntax. These videos are designed for you to code along. These exercises are not required, but they will help build your confidence in ES6. You may also work on these exercises before you begin this module if you prefer.
